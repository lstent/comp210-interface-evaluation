          <h2>Fig 1</h2>
         <h3><p>Figure 1 is a graph showing how easy players found the controls comparing those that looked at the controls screen 
          before the game in orange and those that did not in blue, the Y - axis is the score they gave the controls when asked the 
          higher the number given the more negative they thought, the X - axis keeps track of the number of individuals.</p>
         <p>As expected the players that looked at the controls beforehand found the controls easier than those that did not, the graph 
          also shows that idividuals were more likely to skip the controls, the controls are shown on a splash screen at the start of 
          the game but not for a long enough ammount of time for the player to actually study and remember them, which was one of the
          complaints in the premininary questionnaire.</p></h3>

          <h2>Fig 2</h2>
         <h3><p>Figure 2 compares the mode of all the answers given by the players that looked at the controls before playing the game
          and those that did not. Along the Y - axis is the most common score given by a player, 5 being the most negative veiw of the 
          game and 1 is the positive opinion. The X - axis keeps track of the ammount of players.</p>
         <p>The graph shows that those that new more about the controls before playing had a much more overall positive opinion of the 
          player support in game than those that did not know the controls, one of the main reasons for this could be because the 
          controls screen informs the player how to use the phone, which is where the mission ticklist and iventory is located. Most of
          the players that didn't look at controls were suprised the phone was interactive.</p></h3>

          <h2>Fig 3</h2>
         <h3><p>Figure 3 shows the survival times of players first playthrough the game, using the information of the previous graph
          that players who new the controls found the game more user friendly, does this mean they survived for longer? The Y - axis
          shows time and the Y - axis shows each player</p>
         <p>At first glance the graph seems to show thos that looked at controls got better and thos that did not got worse but these 
          are first goes at the game asked individually without watching each other so the lines rotation is pure coincidence.
          If we compare the range of the orange and blue dots on the graph it does show, the quickest time for the group that didn't
          look at controls is a little lower than the other group, and the longest time, in fact the 3 longest time results were from
          the group that new the controls better. The blue dots seem to be more concentrated than the red, but as the NPC AI roams
          randomly the survival time could be down to luck.</p></h3>

          <h2>Fig 4</h2>
         <h3><p>Figure 4 is the most common feedback from the qualatative interview after playing the game on how to make the game more
          user friendly in their opinion as game developer students and their extensive knowledge of games.</p>
         <p>All four answers were very common with on screen tool-tips being recommended by 9 out of the 10 people asked, tool-tips
          are very common for games to introduce items to the player, what they are for and how to use them, whick would have been ideal
          for the phone and pick-ups.</p>
         <p>Prompts and tutorial were the second most common response to help the user in game especially usefull for the interactives
         which could light up or tell you what button to use to activate, if the player started in a tutorial room at the biginning of
         the game could give a run through of the controls, aim and interactives.</p>
         <p>On screen goal list is the most uncommon response mainly because there is a goal list within the phone, though it is very
          common practice is AAA games, and makes the goals much more obvious to the player.</p></h3>
