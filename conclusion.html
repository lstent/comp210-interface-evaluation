         <h3><p>After discussing the results I think knowing the controls is deffinatly a factor in how easily the game can be played 
         but I think furthur information could have been taken about the individuals themselves especially what year the player was in 
         at the games academy, as it seemed while watching them play the 3rd years at the games academy gave a much more professional 
         opinion and look, whereas the first years were quite shy and afraid of giving bad reviews or advice on how the game could be 
         improved.</p>
         <p>I could have also noted what course they were on as I found designers were a lot more critical of the game, they were more 
         likely to rate everything as negative, even if it was something everyone else rated quite positively, one example of this was 
         the question: Can you tell the difference between a pick-up and an interactable?, the pick-ups light up quite bright when you 
         move towards them so most people rated that as 1 or 2 but designers rated this more as a 4 or 5 even if they do see it 
         immediatly and move towards it.</p>
         <p>Although I have graphs based on my results there is know proof I actually asked anyone, if this text was done again I would
         have used a screen capture to record everyones on screen movements as most people are not happy being filmed.</p>
         <p>The qualatative results I found to be really useful and definatly something to consider when making games in the future 
         provide tool-tips and prompts for the player to increase player support and how easily the game can be picked up by someone
         new.</p></h3>
