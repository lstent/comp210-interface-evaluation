          <h2>Preliminary Questions</h2>
          <h3>Before conducting the main questionnaire I asked 10 individuals to play through the Standby game and comment about
         the most user unfriendly parts of the game, collecting quantative data such as noting down the length of time the game lasted
           before the player won or was killed, how many keycards they collected in the time and if they had managed to win the game. 
           Once the game finnished I asked them qualatative questions on what they thought hindered the player most during the game.

         <h2>UI Questionaire</h2>
         <h3><p>After comparing the results from the preliminary questions from the 10 player it was obvious the main complaint was the
         lack of player support throughout the game, with this knowledge I created a questionnaire focusing on player support.</p>
         <p>I conducted this questionnaire on 20 individuals within the Falmouth games academy. Before the individuals played the game 
         I made sure to put it on the main menu where the option to view controls was available, and made note if the player looked at
         the controls screen before attempting to play the game, I then asked the player 6 questions related to player support: 1.How 
         clear are the controls?, 2.Is the aim obvious?, 3.Is the goal UI easily accessable?, 4.Are the interactables difficult to 
         identify?, 5.Can you tell the difference between pick-ups and interactables?, 6.Is it clear what a pick-up item does?, to 
         which they will answer a number from 1 to 5, 5 being no/really bad and 1 is yes/brillient. Questions 1 - 3 are asked while           
         the player is on their first run through of the game, for questions 5 - 6 after the player has finnished there first play, I 
         will direct the player to an area of the game with several interactables and one pick-up and ask them to if they can find and
         activate an interactable for question 4, for questions 5 and 6, I will tell them there is a pick-up in the same room can they
         find it, ask them how easily they found it then ask if they know what the pick-up does now that they have it.</p>
         <p>After completeing the game depending on there answers I will then conduct an interview asking 10 players how in their 
         oppinion would be the best way to rectify the problem they came accross in game e.g. if they had trouble distinguishing the 
         interactable objects, ask if this was there game how they would change it to make them more obvious or how other games they 
         have played in the past have made interactable objects obvious.</p></h3>
