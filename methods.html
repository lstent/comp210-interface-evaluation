          <h3>Preliminary Questions</h3>
          <h4>Before conducting the main questionnaire I asked 10 individuals to play through the Standby game and comment about
         the most user unfriendly parts of the game, collecting quantative data such as noting down the length of time the game lasted
           before the player won or was killed, how many keycards they collected and if they won the game. Once the game finnished 
           I asked them qualatative questions on what they thought hindered the player most during the game.</h4>

          <h3>UI Questionaire</h3>
          <h4>After comparing the results from the preliminary questions from the 10 player it was obvious the main complaint was the
           lack of player support throughout the game, with this knowledge I created a questionnaire focusing on player support, I 
         will ask the player a question to which they will answer a number from 1 to 5, 5 being no/really bad and 1 is yes/brillient,
         after completeing the game depending on there answers I will ask them how in their oppinion would be the best way to rectify
         this problem.</h4>
